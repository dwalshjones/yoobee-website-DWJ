Just wanted to leave you a little note to say that I've really enjoyed your class, Behshad. It's definitely been difficult, I won't lie. There have been multiple times in making this website when I've struggled with something, but then I've finally figured it out and had a genuine sense of achievement that I had not felt in a while. (Especially with Emmett!)
I wish you all the best in the coming months, and thank you again.

Cheers,

Daniel
